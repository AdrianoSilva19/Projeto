2,3-Omic, huge amount of data
4-the advancement in sequencing tecnhiques allow the producing of the so called biological big data
5-data usefull in the understanding of the diferent cellular conponents and interactions, sistems biology aproaches can help to unlock this problem
6-genome metabolic models have been contructed taking advantage of the multi omics data gathered
gsm takes advantage of the data generated and tries to construct a model for a determinated organism aiming to understand how it works or 
seeking new combinations in its network of interactions that could benefit the human being
