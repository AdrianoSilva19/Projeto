   abstract = {Many studies (in information science) have looked at the growth of science. In this study, we reexamine the question of the growth of science. To do this we (a) use current data up to publication year 2012 and (b) analyze the data across all disciplines and also separately for the natural sciences and for the medical and health sciences. Furthermore, the data were analyzed with an advanced statistical technique - segmented regression analysis - which can identify specific segments with similar growth rates in the history of science. The study is based on two different sets of bibliometric data: (a) the number of publications held as source items in the Web of Science (WoS, Thomson Reuters) per publication year and (b) the number of cited references in the publications of the source items per cited reference year. We looked at the rate at which science has grown since the mid-1600s. In our analysis of cited references we identified three essential growth phases in the development of science, which each led to growth rates tripling in comparison with the previous phase: from less than 1% up to the middle of the 18th century, to 2 to 3% up to the period between the two world wars, and 8 to 9% to 2010.},

   abstract = {The digital revolution is driving significant changes in how people store, distribute, and use information. With the advent of new technologies around linked data, machine learning and large-scale network inference, the natural products research field is beginning to embrace real-time sharing and large-scale analysis of digitized experimental data. Databases play a key role in this, as they allow systematic annotation and storage of data for both basic and advanced applications. The quality of the content, structure, and accessibility of these databases all contribute to their usefulness for the scientific community in practice. This review covers the development of databases relevant for microbial natural product discovery during the past decade (2010-2020), including repositories of chemical structures/properties, metabolomics, and genomic data (biosynthetic gene clusters). It provides an overview of the most important databases and their functionalities, highlights some early meta-analyses using such databases, and discusses some basic principles to enable widespread interoperability between databases. Furthermore, it points out conceptual and practical challenges in the curation and usage of natural products databases. Finally, the review closes with a discussion of key action points required for the field moving forward, not only for database developers but for any scientist active in the field.
